# School_District_Analysis

## Overview and Objective
In This Analysis I am helping my friend Maria replace the ninth grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School so we can then do a full anaylsis of the school district. We are calculating the district summary and the school summary passing percentages of both math, reading, and the overall perentages and how they were affected by replacing those scores.

## This is the district summary.
